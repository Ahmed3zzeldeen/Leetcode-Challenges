# LeetCode Challenges

This repository contains my solutions to various coding challenges I've completed on LeetCode. The challenges cover a range of topics including JavaScript, Data Structures, and Algorithms.

## List of challenges :

- [x] [30-Days-of-JavaScript](./30-Days-of-JavaScript/Readme.md)
- [ ] [100-Days-of-LeetCode](./100-Days-of-LeetCode//Readme.md)
  - [ ] [LeetCode-75-Challenge](./100-Days-of-LeetCode/LeetCode-75-Challenge/Readme.md)
- [ ] [Top-SQL-50-Challenge](./Top-SQL-50-Challenge/README.md)

## Why I Created This Repository

I created this repository to showcase my coding skills and to provide a resource for others who may be working on similar challenges. By sharing my solutions, I hope to help others learn and improve their own coding abilities.

## What You'll Find Here

Inside this repository, you'll find my solutions to LeetCode coding challenges organized by topic and difficulty level. Each solution includes the problem description, my approach to solving the problem, and the code I used to solve it. I've also included comments throughout the code to explain my thought process and reasoning.

## How to Use This Repository

If you're working on a similar coding challenge, you can use my solutions as a reference to help guide your own implementation. However, I encourage you to try to solve the problems on your own before looking at my solutions. This will help you develop your problem-solving skills and improve your coding abilities.
